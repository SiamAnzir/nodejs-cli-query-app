##Description: 

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) Query App which was created by Using **Node JS**. CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions. Command line applications (CLI) are often the main tools for automating tasks, like deploying production applications, running tests, building reports, migrating data, DevOps, and the so many.

**Node.js** is a great solution for writing CLI apps. Node.js itself has built-in libraries for reading and writing files, launching other applications, and basic network communication. Beside that, there are lots of packages available on **npm** for just about any kind of task thinkable.

In this project any one can do query from the database (**data.json**) file by using **Terminal**. **data.json** file was created by using **rows.json** which was downloaded from [here](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rqg5-mkef/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD&fbclid=IwAR36AQjQ1GjOYtqvFAQBuuedL27Sd4-5IalLg7aeEI9WIV1xoagT8IbXurE) .

##Installation: 

To download from GitHub, you should navigate to the top level of the project (SDN in this case) and then a green **"Code"** download button will be visible on the right. Choose the Download ZIP option from the Code pull-down menu. That ZIP file will contain the entire repository content, including the area you wanted. That's the best way to download from GitHub.
After unzipping the project , you have to open it in your Text Editor (Sublime Text or VS Code or webstorm or so on)  . And From that time you have the full access in CLI Query Project,do query as much as you can.

Now You can do query as much as you can through terminal:

![queryResult](img/queryResult.jpg)

if you give any wrong input, it will throw a **error** and its operation will start again:

![throwError](img/throwError.jpg)

Moreover, if you got stuck with something, don't panic. **help** command is always there for you.
